## Markdown Formatting Rules

When writing markdown files, wrap line at 80 character wide to follow markdown standards.

- Do not rely on soft line breaks for structure.
- All multi-line fields should be represented as nested lists.
- Prefer block-level markdown elements (headings, lists) over inline formatting
